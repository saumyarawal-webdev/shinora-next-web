                  <h3>Introduction</h3>
                  <p>
                    Teeth whitening is one of the most sought-after cosmetic
                    dental treatments, offering a quick and noticeable boost to
                    your smile. At Shinora Clinic, Dr. Chandni Kalaria often
                    discusses the potential and versatility of teeth whitening
                    treatments with our patients. As noted by the American
                    Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry, the most common desire among
                    people when it comes to improving their smile is achieving
                    whiter and brighter teeth.

                  <h3>Crucial facts about Teeth Whitening</h3>

                      <b>Causes of Tooth Discoloration: </b>
                      <p>
                        Discoloration can be attributed to various factors,
                        including the consumption of stain-inducing foods and
                        beverages like coffee, tea, and red wine. Additionally,
                        smoking contributes significantly to stains due to the
                        tar and nicotine content. Medications, aging, and
                        certain medical treatments can also alter the color of
                        your teeth, making them appear more yellow as the enamel
                        wears thin over time.

                      <b>How Teeth Whitening Works: </b>
                      <p>
                        Teeth whitening utilizes bleaching agents—typically
                        hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide—that penetrate
                        the enamel to break down the stains that have settled
                        deeper within the teeth, beyond the surface. This
                        chemical process, known as oxidation, effectively lifts
                        stains, resulting in a brighter smile.

                      <b>Teeth Whitening Options: </b>
                      <p>
                        Patients at Shinora Clinic can choose between
                        professional in-office whitening and at-home treatments:

                      <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'circle' }}>
                        <li>
                          <b>In-Office Whitening:</b> This method involves the
                          use of high-concentration bleaching gels and is often
                          accelerated by a special light or laser, offering
                          dramatic results in under 90 minutes.

                        <li>
                          <b>At-Home Whitening:</b> For those preferring to
                          whiten teeth at their convenience, at-home kits like
                          whitening strips and custom-fitted trays can also be
                          effective, though they may require more time to
                          achieve similar results.
                        </li>

                      <b>Suitability of Teeth Whitening: </b>
                      <p>
                        Not all types of discoloration respond to whitening
                        treatments. Yellowish teeth tend to bleach well, while
                        brownish or grayish hues may not bleach effectively.
                        Additionally, whitening treatments do not alter the
                        color of dental restorations such as crowns or veneers.

                      <b>Potential Side Effects: </b>
                      <p>
                        While teeth whitening is safe for most individuals, some
                        may experience temporary tooth sensitivity or mild gum
                        irritation, especially if the bleaching agent comes into
                        contact with the gum tissue. These symptoms are usually
                        transient and subside shortly after the treatment.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                  </ol>
