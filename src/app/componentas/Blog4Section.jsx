                  <h3>Introduction</h3>
                  <p>
                    Dehydrated skin is a common concern that affects many, often
                    mistaken for simply having dry skin. At Shinora Clinic, Dr.
                    Bhavarth Kalaria sheds light on what truly causes skin
                    dehydration, how it differs from dry skin, and the effective
                    treatments available for this condition.
                  </p>
                  <h3>What is Dehydrated Skin?</h3>
                  <p>
                    Unlike dry skin, which lacks oil, dehydrated skin lacks
                    water. It can feel tight, look dull, and may even cause
                    increased sensitivity and fine lines. This condition isn't
                    limited to those with dry skin; even oily skin types can
                    experience dehydration. Dr. Kalaria explains that hydrated
                    skin appears plump, soft, and radiant due to its high water
                    content, which can fluctuate dramatically based on
                    environmental factors and lifestyle choices.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Key Differences: Dry vs. Dehydrated Skin</h3>
                  <ol style={{ listStyleType: 'number' }}>
                    <li>
                      <b>Dry Skin: </b>Typically lacks sebum (oil) and may
                      appear flaky, rough, and dull. It often requires products
                      that help to replenish the skin's natural oils. Dehydrated
                      Skin: Lacks water content, can feel tight and show signs
                      of premature aging, like fine lines. It benefits from
                      products that increase water content and prevent water
                      loss.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Poor Oral Hygiene: </b>Inadequate brushing and flossing
                      allow plaque to accumulate on the teeth, increasing the
                      risk of cavities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>High Sugar and Starch Intake: </b>Consuming sugary and
                      starchy foods and drinks feeds the bacteria in your mouth,
                      leading to acid production and enamel erosion.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Acidic Foods and Drinks: </b>Acidic beverages like
                      sodas and citrus fruits can weaken tooth enamel, making it
                      more susceptible to decay.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Dry Mouth: </b>Saliva plays a crucial role in
                      neutralizing acids and washing away food particles. A dry
                      mouth environment can increase the risk of cavities.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <h3>Symptoms of Cavities</h3>
                  <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc' }}>
